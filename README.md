# Basecamp: SIP_07_2019

My attempt at the [SIP assignment](https://gist.github.com/rosa/783d23a4a835b9a81ea7e8cec5eaf671) for the [Basecamp senior programmer opening on the Security, Infrastructure & Performance team](https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-a-senior-programmer/).  
It includes [2 PRs](https://github.com/philip-maina/basecamp-SIP_07_2019/pulls) showing the tradeoffs made in terms of development effort, delivery speed and craft.
